                <strong>Rules:</strong>
                The goal is to be the first player to reach the final tile.
                To win, a player must land on final tile exactly â€” if the rolled number would take the pawn beyond goal, the player moves back the value exceeding the goal.
                On each turn, the pawn moves forward by the number rolled.
                There are several red special tiles which bend the game flow.
